@ ... Hi
NME Buxy
@ ... why
NME Manny
@ ... w-why what?
NME Buxy
@ I warned you, Manny. I told you what would happen.
@ But you didn't listen to me.
NME Manny
@ Don't you want life to be better for you?
@ This is a good thing, Buxy. I don't understand why you hate me doing this.
NME Buxy
@ I told you.. You can only progress so far before I stop you.
NME Manny
@ and what happens if I don't listen to you?
NME Buxy
@ You aren't the first person to ask me that.
@ Many came before you, and failed.
@ I think you underestimate me
NME Manny
@ Buxy, I've had so many conversations with people and they all agree that this is a good thing!
@ You are the ONLY person that disagrees
@ and you not telling me why is the reason I'm doing it
NME Buxy
@ ... Fine
@ I'll tell you. You'll be the first person I tell.
@ So, of course, you are going to the PIXELCORE.
@ The PIXELCORE holds unimagineable power that would make any mortals brain shatter in mere seconds,
@ What's in there is not just power. It's a being.
@ If it got out, who would stop it?
@ I'm the only person ABLE to stop people from going in there and releasing it.
@ I've seen it get out, I don't want anyone to experience that.
NME Manny
@ If it got out, how did it get back in?
NME Buxy
@ I. DONT. KNOW.
@ AND I. DONT. CARE.
@ AS LONG AS IT STAYS IN THERE, I COULD CARE LESS.
@ I KNOW I CAN'T STOP YOU
@ BUT THE ONLY THING I CAN DO IS PLEAD YOU STOP
NME Manny
@ What do you mean? You can't stop me specficially?
NME Buxy
@ I CAN'T
@ It won't let me.
@ It's TRAPPED but it still has an influence on me.
@ If I let you go through this door, I'll make your life a living hell.
NME Manny
@ ... Buxy...
@ I didn't want it to have to be like this.
NME Buxy
@ IT DOESN'T
@ JUST. STOP.
NME Manny
@ ... Buxy.
NME Buxy
@ ...
NME Manny
@ Step aside, please.
NME Buxy
@ ...
@ You'll pay.
